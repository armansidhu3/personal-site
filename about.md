I like working with computers and learning new innovative technologies.

Outside of school, I develop interesting projects revolving around machine learning.

My most recent resume is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uc3R471lOtndp_cevWr4UahIv9D9cesU/view?usp=sharing).     

I'm always open to hearing about new opportunities in both industry and research. Don't hesitate to drop me a [line](mailto:armansidhu3@gmail.com).
